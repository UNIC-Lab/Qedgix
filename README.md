# GNN-Empowered Effective Partial Observation MARL Method for AoI Management in Multi-UAV Network
This is the code for the paper GNN-Empowered Effective Partial Observation MARL Method for AoI Management in Multi-UAV Network, published in IEEE IoT J. 

1. Unzip the pymarl folder while running the code and put the extracted files in the root directory.
* The raw code of pymarl can be found in the https://github.com/hijkzzz/pymarl2
* The ff_agent.py and atten_rnn_agent.py are never used in the code, so if there is an error about them, please just delete related code about ff_agent.py and atten_rnn_agent.py
